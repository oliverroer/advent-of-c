[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) problems, solved in C.

## TODO

### Figure out how to do testing

[Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/getting-started-with-unity/) could be an option.
Microsoft also has some [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/writing-unit-tests-for-c-cpp?view=vs-2017).
